> **Revolutionary Payment Streaming Protocol on Stacks Blockchain**

FluxPay transforms how digital payments work by enabling continuous, programmable money flows that stream in real-time. Built on the Stacks blockchain with Bitcoin's security, FluxPay eliminates the friction of traditional lump-sum payments by creating fluid financial streams that flow automatically over time.

## 🌊 What is FluxPay?

FluxPay is a decentralized payment streaming protocol that allows users to create continuous payment flows instead of discrete transactions. Think of it as "Netflix for payments" - where money flows continuously rather than in chunks.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional digital payments are binary: they either happen or they don't. This creates friction for:
- **Freelancers** waiting for milestone payments
- **Employees** receiving monthly salaries when they work daily
- **Subscription services** dealing with failed payments and renewals
- **Investors** managing complex vesting schedules
- **DAOs** distributing rewards fairly over time

### Our Solution

FluxPay enables **payment streams** - continuous flows of cryptocurrency that transfer value every second, creating a more natural and flexible payment experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Continuous Flow**: Payments stream every second, not in lump sums
- **Precision Timing**: Accurate calculations down to the second
- **Flexible Duration**: Streams can last minutes, hours, days, or years

### 🔒 Bitcoin-Secured Infrastructure
- **Stacks Integration**: Smart contracts with Bitcoin's security
